# Grade 12 IT Practical Assessment Task 2023
## üì¢ What is the Practical Assessment Task (PAT)? 
A practical assessment task (PAT) mark is a compulsory component of the final
promotion mark for all candidates offering subjects that have a practical component
and counts 25% (100 marks) of the end-of-the-year examination mark. The PAT is
implemented across the first three terms of the school year. This is broken down into
different phases or a series of smaller activities that make up the PAT. The PAT
allows for learners to be assessed on a regular basis during the school year and it
also allows for the assessment of skills that cannot be assessed in a written format,
e.g. test or examination. It is therefore important that schools ensure that all learners
complete the practical assessment tasks within the stipulated period to ensure that
learners are resulted at the end of the school year. The planning and execution of the
PAT differs from subject to subject.
